Vagrant Dev VM

This is a simple DevVM verison with Deviant 6.0.8 (Squeezy)

Added into this environment is MySQL, PHP, Apache, PhpmyAdmin, Vim, Curl, Git, and debconf tools. Highly recommend to change the password after starting up the VM.

Requires Vagrant to run, so make sure to install this.

General commands are:

git clone git@github.com:The-Outrider/DebianVM.git
vagrant up
(wait)
vagrant ssh

DONE! You have a fully working Debian VM with PHP, MySQL, and Git!
